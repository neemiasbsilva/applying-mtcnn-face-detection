This repository has as goal to use the __Multi-task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network__ (MTCNN) for face detection. Basically, MTCNN is devided in three steges. The first stage contain a prediction of candidate facial regions (P-Net), the second stages filters the bounding boxes (R-net), and the third and last stage proposes facial landmarks (O-Net). For know more about the technique, please read the referenced paper (find in the section call Reference).


## Datasets Used

<h6 align="center">Real and Fake Face Detection dataset, available in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection">kaggle</a> competition.</h6>

For apply the MTCNN approach was choosed 10 images. The first nine images is available in the dataset called __Real and Fake Face Detection__, this dataset can be acess free from the [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ciplab/real-and-fake-face-detection) competetion. The last image was capture by photographer _Bob N. Renee_.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

```
Good knowledgment in Deep Convolutional Neural Network, Computer Vision, and know how to use ".sh" file.
```

### Installing

First thing first, install the mtcnn package, that contain the implementation of architecture and packages dependecie:

```
pip install mtcnn
```

### Usage

For run this repository, please open the terminal and run the following command:

```
 sh run.sh
```

## Result

When you run the run.sh file, you get as result the face and landmark detection of each image. The figure bellow show how the result of MTCNN techniques it is.
