This repository has as goal to use the __Multi-task Cascade Convolutional Neural Network__ (MTCNN) for face detection. Basically, MTCNN is devided in three steges. The first stage contain a prediction of candidate facial regions (P-Net), the second stages filters the bounding boxes (R-net), and the third and last stage proposes facial landmarks (O-Net). For know more about the technique, please read the referenced paper (find in the section call Reference).
